Sure! Here’s the super-simple, minimal version of installing KVM on Ubuntu:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
sudo usermod -aG libvirt,kvm $(whoami)
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
sudo kvm-ok

Installs KVM and tools

Adds your user to KVM groups

Starts KVM service

Checks if virtualization works


After this, you can run virt-manager to create VMs.

If you want, I can make it one single command that does everything including launching virt-manager.












Perfect! Here’s a condensed version of the commands for each method so you can copy-paste directly. I’ll assume:

VM1 IP: 192.168.56.101

VM2 IP: 192.168.56.102

User: user

Folder to share: /home/user/shared



---

1. Shared Folder (Host ↔ VM via VirtualBox/VMware)

# On VM: create mount point and mount host shared folder
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
sudo mount -t vboxsf HostSharedFolderName /mnt/shared

Files in /mnt/shared can be accessed by VM and host.



---

2. Networking VMs (SSH/SCP)

# On VM1: install SSH server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh

# On VM2: copy folder from VM1
scp -r user@192.168.56.101:/home/user/shared /home/user/

Replace IP and username as needed.



---

3. VM ↔ Host Transfer (using SCP)

# VM → Host
scp -r /home/user/shared user@HOST_IP:/path/on/host

# Host → VM
scp -r user@HOST_IP:/path/on/host /home/user/destination

Requires SSH server running on VM or host.



---

4. Mount Using SSH (SSHFS)

# On VM2: install sshfs
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y sshfs

# Mount VM1 folder locally
mkdir ~/remote_shared
sshfs user@192.168.56.101:/home/user/shared ~/remote_shared

# Unmount when done
fusermount -u ~/remote_shared


---

✅ With these commands, you can transfer folders between VMs, between VM and host, or mount remote folders easily.

If you want, I can make a single script that handles VM-to-VM folder transfer automatically for all these methods. Do you want me to do that?








Sure! Here’s a simple command-line setup for both DevStack (full OpenStack) and MicroStack (lightweight OpenStack) on Ubuntu.


---

1️⃣ MicroStack (fast & simple)

# Update and install snap
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y snapd

# Install MicroStack
sudo snap install microstack --classic

# Initialize MicroStack (control node)
sudo microstack init --auto --control

# Check OpenStack token
sudo microstack.openstack token issue

# Access dashboard in browser: https://<VM_IP>/  (admin password shown in init)

✅ Pros: Very fast, works on any Ubuntu version, all-in-one.


---

2️⃣ DevStack (full OpenStack, more flexible, learning/dev only)

# Update system and install git
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git curl

# Create stack user
sudo adduser stack
sudo usermod -aG sudo stack
su - stack

# Download DevStack
git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack
cd devstack

# Create minimal local.conf
echo -e "[[local|localrc]]\nADMIN_PASSWORD=Secret123\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=Secret123\nRABBIT_PASSWORD=Secret123\nSERVICE_PASSWORD=Secret123" > local.conf

# Run installation
./stack.sh

# Access dashboard in browser: http://<VM_IP>/dashboard
# Login: admin / Secret123

✅ Pros: Full OpenStack environment, good for testing, learning, and scripting.
⚠️ Cons: Slower (10–30 min), heavier on resources, mainly for dev/test.


---

💡 Summary:

Use MicroStack for fast setup and lightweight testing.

Use DevStack if you want full OpenStack experience and more control.


If you want, I can make a single one-line command for each that installs them fully automatically, no editing needed.

Do you want me to do that?
