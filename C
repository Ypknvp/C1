Sure! Here’s the super-simple, minimal version of installing KVM on Ubuntu:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
sudo usermod -aG libvirt,kvm $(whoami)
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
sudo kvm-ok

Installs KVM and tools

Adds your user to KVM groups

Starts KVM service

Checks if virtualization works


After this, you can run virt-manager to create VMs.

If you want, I can make it one single command that does everything including launching virt-manager.












Perfect! Here’s a condensed version of the commands for each method so you can copy-paste directly. I’ll assume:

VM1 IP: 192.168.56.101

VM2 IP: 192.168.56.102

User: user

Folder to share: /home/user/shared



---

1. Shared Folder (Host ↔ VM via VirtualBox/VMware)

# On VM: create mount point and mount host shared folder
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/shared
sudo mount -t vboxsf HostSharedFolderName /mnt/shared

Files in /mnt/shared can be accessed by VM and host.



---

2. Networking VMs (SSH/SCP)

# On VM1: install SSH server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh

# On VM2: copy folder from VM1
scp -r user@192.168.56.101:/home/user/shared /home/user/

Replace IP and username as needed.



---

3. VM ↔ Host Transfer (using SCP)

# VM → Host
scp -r /home/user/shared user@HOST_IP:/path/on/host

# Host → VM
scp -r user@HOST_IP:/path/on/host /home/user/destination

Requires SSH server running on VM or host.



---

4. Mount Using SSH (SSHFS)

# On VM2: install sshfs
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y sshfs

# Mount VM1 folder locally
mkdir ~/remote_shared
sshfs user@192.168.56.101:/home/user/shared ~/remote_shared

# Unmount when done
fusermount -u ~/remote_shared


---

✅ With these commands, you can transfer folders between VMs, between VM and host, or mount remote folders easily.

If you want, I can make a single script that handles VM-to-VM folder transfer automatically for all these methods. Do you want me to do that?

sudo systemctl restart networking
ip a
route -n
brctl show
Linux Bridge: Method 2 (Temporary)
Bash

sudo -s
apt install bridge-utils
brctl addbr br-cloud
brctl addif br-cloud enp0s3
ifconfig enp0s3 0
ifconfig br-cloud 10.0.2.15 netmask 255.255.255.0

Open vSwitch (OVS) Setup
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvswitch-switch-y
sudo systemctl start openvswitch-switch
sudo systemctl enable openvswitch-switch
sudo systemctl status openvswitch-switch
sudo ovs-vsctl add-br ovs-br0
sudo ovs-vsctl add-port ovs-br0 enp0s3
sudo ovs-vsctl show


Of course! Here are the complete commands and their explanations from the document for creating virtual networks with Linux Bridge and Open vSwitch.

Linux Bridge: Method 1 (Persistent Configuration)
This method involves editing a configuration file to make the bridge setup permanent, so it survives a reboot.

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces


Explanation: This command opens the primary network configuration file (/etc/network/interfaces) in the nano text editor with administrator (sudo) privileges. You edit this file to define the bridge and link it to a physical network card.

sudo systemctl restart networking


Explanation: After saving changes to the interfaces file, this command restarts the system's networking service to apply the new configuration.

ip a


Explanation: This is used to verify the setup by displaying information for all network interfaces. The output shows the new bridge (br-cloud) with its assigned IP address and the physical interface (enp0s3) now part of the bridge.

route -n


Explanation: Shows the kernel's IP routing table. It's used to confirm that the default gateway is correctly set to route traffic through the new bridge interface (br-cloud).

brctl show


Explanation: This command lists all active bridges and the network interfaces attached to them. It's a final check to see the br-cloud bridge and its connected port (enp0s3).

Linux Bridge: Method 2 (Temporary Commands)
This method uses a series of commands to create a bridge that will not persist after a system restart.

sudo -s


Explanation: Switches your current session to the root user, allowing you to run administrative commands without typing sudo each time.

apt install bridge-utils


Explanation: Installs the bridge-utils package, which contains the necessary tools (like brctl) to create and manage Linux bridges.

brctl addbr br-cloud


Explanation: Creates a new, empty Linux bridge named br-cloud.

brctl addif br-cloud enp0s3


Explanation: Attaches a physical network interface card (in this case, enp0s3) to the br-cloud bridge, allowing the bridge to send and receive traffic through it.

ifconfig enp0s3 0


Explanation: Removes any existing IP address from the physical interface (enp0s3). This is necessary because the bridge itself will now manage the IP address.

ifconfig br-cloud 10.0.2.15 netmask 255.255.255.0


Explanation: Assigns the IP address 10.0.2.15 and netmask 255.255.255.0 directly to the br-cloud bridge interface.

route add default gw 10.0.2.15 dev br-cloud


Explanation: Sets the default gateway for the system. Note: The command in the document incorrectly sets the bridge's own IP as the gateway. It should typically be the router's IP address on the network (e.g., 10.0.2.2 as seen in Method 1 ).

Open vSwitch (OVS) Setup
OVS is a more advanced virtual switch used in cloud environments.

sudo apt update


Explanation: Resynchronizes the package index files from their sources, ensuring you have the latest information about available software packages.

sudo apt install openvswitch-switch-y


Explanation: Installs the main Open vSwitch software package. Note: The -y is appended to the package name in the document, which is a typo. It should be a space (sudo apt install openvswitch-switch -y) to auto-confirm the installation.

sudo systemctl start openvswitch-switch


Explanation: Starts the Open vSwitch daemon (service).

sudo systemctl enable openvswitch-switch


Explanation: Configures the Open vSwitch service to start automatically every time the system boots up.

sudo systemctl status openvswitch-switch


Explanation: Checks the current status of the OVS service to confirm that it is active and running without errors.

sudo ovs-vsctl add-br ovs-br0


Explanation: Uses the OVS control utility (ovs-vsctl) to create a new OVS bridge named ovs-br0. Note: The command in the document has a typo (ovs-bro), but the output shows the correct name (ovs-br0).

sudo ovs-vsctl add-port ovs-br0 enp0s3


Explanation: Adds the physical network interface (enp0s3) as a port to the ovs-br0 bridge, connecting the virtual switch to the physical network.

sudo ovs-vsctl show


Explanation: Displays a summary of the OVS configuration, showing all bridges, their associated ports, and interfaces to verify the setup.

# Check disk usage (before filesystem resize)
df -h

# Resize the filesystem to use the new space
resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv

# Verify the final disk usage
df -h





















Of course! Here are the commands from the document, along with their output, explanation, and the next step in the procedure.

1. Switch to Root User

Command: sudo -s 


Output: The command prompt changes from a standard user (osboxes@osboxes:~$) to the root user (root@osboxes:/home/osboxes#).

Explanation: This command elevates your privileges to the root user, which is necessary for managing storage devices.


Next Step: List the available disks to identify the new one.

2. List Disks and Partitions

Command: fdisk -l 

Output: A list of all block devices is shown. The newly added 25 GiB disk is identified as /dev/sdb.

Explanation: This command lists all disks and partitions recognized by the system, allowing you to find the device name for the new virtual disk.


Next Step: Display current LVM configurations, starting with Physical Volumes.

3. Display LVM Status (PV, VG, LV)
Commands:


pvdisplay 


vgdisplay 


lvdisplay 


Output: For all three commands, no specific output is shown in the document, indicating that no LVM structures existed prior to this setup.

Explanation: These commands are used to check the status of existing Physical Volumes (PVs), Volume Groups (VGs), and Logical Volumes (LVs), respectively.


Next Step: Initialize the new disk as a Physical Volume.

4. Create Physical Volume (PV)

Command: pvcreate /dev/sdb 


Output: Physical volume "/dev/sdb" successfully created..

Explanation: This command initializes the disk /dev/sdb so it can be used as a building block for LVM.


Next Step: Create a Volume Group from the new PV.

5. Create Volume Group (VG)

Command: vgcreate ubuntu-vg /dev/sdb 


Output: Volume group "ubuntu-vg" successfully created.


Explanation: This creates a new storage pool named ubuntu-vg using the space from the /dev/sdb physical volume.


Next Step: Create a Logical Volume within the new VG.

6. Create Logical Volume (LV)

Command: lvcreate -L 10G -n ubuntu-lv ubuntu-vg 


Output: Logical volume "ubuntu-lv" created..


Explanation: This command carves out a 10 GB virtual partition named ubuntu-lv from the ubuntu-vg storage pool.


Next Step: Format the new logical volume with a filesystem.

7. Create Filesystem

Command: mkfs.ext4 /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv 


Output: The system reports the successful creation of an ext4 filesystem, showing details like its UUID and backup locations.

Explanation: This command formats the ubuntu-lv with the ext4 filesystem, preparing it to store data.


Next Step: Create a mount point directory.

8. Create and Use a Mount Point
Commands:


mkdir /mnt/lvm-demo 


mount /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv /mnt/lvm-demo 


Output: The commands execute without any specific output, indicating success.



Explanation: First, a directory /mnt/lvm-demo is created to serve as an access point. Then, the ubuntu-lv logical volume is attached (mounted) to that directory, making it accessible to the file system.



Next Step: Resize the logical volume to add more space.

9. Resize Logical Volume

Command: lvresize --size +12G ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv 


Output: Size of logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv changed from 10.00 GiB (2560 extents) to 22.00 GiB (5632 extents)..


Explanation: This command increases the size of ubuntu-lv by 12 GB, for a new total of 22 GB. The filesystem on it, however, remains at its original 10 GB size.


Next Step: Check the disk usage to see the discrepancy.

10. Check Disk Usage (Before Filesystem Resize)

Command: df -h 


Output: The output table shows /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv is still only 9.8G in size, even though the logical volume was expanded.

Explanation: This command displays the size and usage of mounted filesystems. It confirms that the filesystem itself has not yet been expanded to use the newly available space.


Next Step: Resize the filesystem to fill the expanded volume.

11. Resize Filesystem

Command: resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 


Output: The command reports a successful online resize and states the new, larger block count of the filesystem.

Explanation: This command expands the ext4 filesystem to fill all the available space on its underlying logical volume.


Next Step: Verify the successful extension of the filesystem
